vim-draftin
------

Work in progress plugin for the excellent writing tool [https://draftin.com](Draft)

Dependencies
----

When creating/uploading a document the first time, a JSON response is received.
To parse this and extract the id,
[vim-scripts/ParseJSON](https://github.com/vim-scripts/ParseJSON) is used. 

If the text/content contains certain characters (e.g. if you write about code), they 
may have to be escaped in JSON.
[vim-scripts/jsoncodecs.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/jsoncodecs.vim)
handles this.

Installation
----

I highly recommend [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), which
makes installation very simple:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/bartek/vim-draftin.git

Assuming you have pathogen setup, the plugin will automatically be installed.

Configuration
----

You'll need to set your [https://draftin.com](Draft) credentials to be able to
POST new documents. Within .vimrc (or in a file sourced from .vimrc):

    let g:draftin_auth = "username:password"

Usage
----

* `:Draft` will upload the document to Draft, echo'ing back the url.
